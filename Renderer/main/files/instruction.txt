General Considerations:
    1. The renderer does not have the capability to buffer so it just renders what it receives from the server.
    2. During the streaming session, controller can request the renderer to pause/resume/start-from -the-beginning the streaming.
    3. The controller, renderer, and server must run on different hosts.
    4. For media file types, at minimum text files must be supported.
